# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Step 1: npx create-react-app replicated-site

Step 2: yarn/npm add // to add the yarn/npm inside our project

Step 3: yarn/npm start // It will start the Code & will Display in Browser

Step 4: Clear the unnecessary codes & Files // remove the Unnecessary files & Codes from the React-app

Step 5: Build the Structure of Project, So it will be easy to follow next time // It helps to clear your thought & follow the plan

Step 6: Install "chartjs" & "chartjs3" // It will help to build Charts in your project/ Even you can use chartjs different version too(In this project I had used "chartjs" & "charts2/3")

Step 7: You can either use JSON as a downloaded file inside the project or you can fetch it as a API // In my case I downloaded the file & used as a file named "data.json".

Step 8: Fetched the JSON data as per requirement // Basically I used JSON.map() to retrieve the data

Step 9: Once all the data fetched you are all set to go for Chart representaion // Build the chart as per given data in "Chartjs" and insert the retrieved data as per requirement specially in Array format.

Step 10: Once the Bar Chart & Scatter Plot Chart Completed // You can Style a bit of Increasing the Size() or Decreasing the size() as per your Screen

Step 11: Deploy the project on GitHub as well as GitHub pages // To able to catch your website on Online

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
